## Features

- Black-Scholes Pricing: Calculates theoretical prices for European Call and Put options.
- AI-Powered Volatility: Utilizes a Python microservice with a Scikit-learn model (trained on real market data) to predict implied volatility.
- Microservices Architecture: Decoupled Java backend and Python AI service for modularity and scalability.
- Containerized: Fully containerized using Docker for consistent environments.
- Automated CI/CD: GitHub Actions pipeline automatically builds and pushes images to AWS ECR on every push to main.
- Cloud Deployed: Live demonstration running on AWS EC2.
